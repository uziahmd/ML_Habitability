A Machine Learning Approach for the Identification of the Habitable Planets using the Astronomical Data
We have a growing need to manage terabytes of astronomical data produced every night. A huge amount of data is available on exoplanets that needs to be processed and classified. Machine learning is the modern solution to classification problems in large data sets, with specialized models to carry out the task automatically with high accuracy. We assessed the potential of neural networks and decision trees as habitability classifiers. We worked on habitable exoplanet catalog, prepared a dataset suitable for machine learning and split it 7:3 in training and testing sets. We also applied the latest bagging and boosting methods to decision trees to optimize learning and prevent overfitting. We found XG boost to provide the most accurate and precise predictive model. Moreover, using XG boost We found planetâ€™s radius and solar insolation to be the most significant factors when determining habitability of an exoplanet.
